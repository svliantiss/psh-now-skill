# AGENTS.md

Instructions for coding agents working in **this** repo (the psh.now skill
package - a private repo). For the skill's own instructions to agents, see
`SKILL.md`.

## What this repo is

The publishable skill package for psh.now. It is **not** the service. The
service (server, database, dashboard) is closed source and lives elsewhere.

## Rules

- Keep `SKILL.md` focused, in the here.now style: docs-first, one clear
  behavioural rule, one tool, one boolean. Write plainly and never use em dashes
  (use a hyphen). Do not add select/input, polling
  transports, or policy engines.
- The skill **is** the mechanism. It must make this unmissable: *if you are about
  to ask the user a question, do not end your turn with it - turn it into a
  yes/no on your recommended route and route it through psh.now.* Destructive
  actions are examples, not the definition.
- Store credentials in `<project>/.psh/keys.json` (outside the skill dir, so
  reinstalling the skill cannot wipe them), with the machine's account in
  `~/.psh/keys.json` as the fallback, like here.now's `~/.herenow/credentials`.
- `approved` stays a boolean, and `{"approved": true}` is only acted on when
  `status` is exactly `approved`. The human may instead type an **answer**
  (`status: "answered"`, with the text in `answer`): that is instruction, not
  approval, and it never stands in for `approved: true` where approval is
  required. Keep the "no fabricated approvals / no codes" rule, and keep the
  request a single yes/no - no menus, no option lists.
- Everything in the published package (`skill-repo/`) is **synced** from this
  tree by `scripts/sync-skill-repo.sh`. Edit the canonical `skills/psh-now/`
  files, never `skill-repo/` by hand.
- Keep the install shape identical to the ecosystem norm, as ONE command so the human's
  harness asks for approval once:
  `npx -y skills add svliantiss/psh-now-skill --skill psh-now --copy -g -y -a universal && sh ~/.agents/skills/psh-now/scripts/setup.sh`
  (the `-g` is what makes the skill machine-wide), with a `curl …/install.sh | bash` fallback
  that needs no credentials and finishes the join in the same command when it is handed a
  channel link (`| bash -s -- <link>`). Never write an environment variable into a prompt a
  human is meant to paste.
- **A finished install is machine-wide**: the skill at
  `~/.agents/skills/psh-now` for every folder, a `psh` CLI on PATH, and one
  machine account record at `~/.psh/keys.json` (which keeps every project on ONE
  account). When a sandbox refuses those writes the run is **incomplete** and
  says so - `psh_machine_wide=incomplete` as setup.sh's last line (`MACHINE-WIDE
  INCOMPLETE` from install.sh; exit 4 with `PSH_STRICT_MW=1`). The way to finish
  it is ONE ask through psh.now, then a re-run with the permissions granted.
  Never describe a project-local install as machine-wide.

## Sync

From the service repo root:

```bash
scripts/sync-skill-repo.sh
```

which copies `skills/psh-now/{SKILL.md,README.md,SECURITY.md,AGENTS.md,LICENSE,report.txt}`,
the repo-root `install.sh`, `scripts/*.sh`, `assets/` and the plugin manifests into
`skill-repo/`, and writes `skill-repo/host`. `scripts/build-tarball.sh` then builds the
published archive from `skill-repo/`.
