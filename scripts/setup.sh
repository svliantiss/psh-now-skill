If a human says "use psh now" / "ask me first", run this first:

  psh doctor     # connectivity + credentials

Keys are **per project**: each project keeps its own in <project>/.psh/keys.json,
so this directory holds no identity of its own. Don't mint a second account for
a human who already has one.
