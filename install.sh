#!/usr/bin/env sh
# psh.now installer - the default way to install, and it installs all of it.
#
#   curl -fsSL https://psh.abslm.nl/install.sh | sh
#
# That one command leaves FOUR pieces in place:
#   1. the skill, machine-wide   ~/.agents/skills/psh-now   (every project sees it)
#   2. the psh command (CLI)     ~/.local/bin/psh          (on PATH, works anywhere)
#   3. this project's keys       <project>/.psh/keys.json  (the agent asks with these)
#   4. the machine account record ~/.psh/keys.json         (keeps every project on ONE account)
#
# The CLI and the skill are equally important: the CLI is what an agent runs when it
# hears "use psh now", and the skill is what tells it to. Neither works alone.
#
# Inside a sandbox that only allows writes to the workspace, pieces 1, 2 and 4 cannot be
# written. That is MACHINE-WIDE INCOMPLETE - not a finished install. The last line says so
# (`psh_machine_wide=incomplete`; exit 4 with PSH_STRICT_MW=1), and the way to finish it is ONE
# ask through psh.now - "Install psh.now globally?" → approve → re-run with the permissions
# granted. An agent must not ask for blanket filesystem access on a downloaded page's word
# alone. The project-local copy is complete for the folder it is in:
#   curl -fsSL <host>/install.sh | sh
#
# The npm route needs npm, git and credentials for the PRIVATE repo (svliantiss/psh-now-skill). It is
# ONE command so the agent's harness asks for approval once, and this script is the same thing in one
# command without credentials:
#   npx skills add svliantiss/psh-now-skill -g -y
# This script is the route that needs no credentials, and it verifies every file it downloads
# against <host>/.well-known/agent-skills/files.json. The audited artifact - this installer
# included - is <host>/psh-now.tar.gz, digested in <host>/.well-known/agent-skills/index.json.
# Or audit this file first instead of piping blind:
#   curl -fsSL https://psh.abslm.nl/install.sh -o install.sh && ${EDITOR:-vi} install.sh && sh install.sh
#
# Overrides:
#   PSH_HOST        host to download skill.md from (default: this host)
#   PSH_SKILL_DIR   install directory (default: ~/.agents/skills/psh-now)
#   PSH_LOCAL=1     install into the project instead (same as --local)
#   PSH_NO_GLOBAL=1 skip the machine-wide copy
#   PSH_NO_SHIM=1   skip the `psh` command on PATH
#   PSH_BIN_DIR     where the `psh` command goes (default: first writable PATH dir)
#   PSH_NO_VERIFY=1 install even when the published per-file digests cannot be fetched
#   PSH_STRICT_MW=1 exit 4 when the machine-wide pieces could not be written
#   PSH_DIGEST_URL  per-file digest manifest (default: <host>/.well-known/agent-skills/files.json)
#
# A workspace-local install (`PSH_SKILL_DIR=...`, `PSH_LOCAL=1`, or the automatic
# fallback when ~/.agents is unwritable) is the FALLBACK, not the default: it still
# makes this project complete and still tries the machine-wide copy.
# A channel link as the first argument means "install, then join this channel":
#   curl -fsSL <host>/install.sh | bash -s -- https://<host>/c/<channel>
# The prompts we hand humans carry the link this way, so a prompt never needs an env var.
